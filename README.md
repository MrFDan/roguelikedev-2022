# RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial 2022 Edition

This repository contains the code to an unnamed roguelike project done in Game Maker Language (GML) for the r\roguelikdev's [Complete Roguelike Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/vhfsda/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/). My goal is to follow general theme of the week, but add things that interest me the most in my own pace. Although the game itself does not have a name, I do have a specific vision for it.
